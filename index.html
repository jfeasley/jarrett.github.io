<p>For as long as I can remember, I was always interested in taking things apart. I just had to know how everything works, from toys to kitchen appliances.   (<a href="http://imgur.com/a/VPhHL">http://imgur.com/a/VPhHL</a>)</p>

<p>As I got older, I wanted to know more about how more complicated technologies worked. This led to my interest in computers. In the winter of 2012 I built my first computer by myself with only information that i gained from online videos. I was so excited that I was able to understand and build a computer, a feat that the rest of my family thought was magic. After my first computer my thirst for further in formation only got larger. In total, I have built 6 computers for friends and family, and my current PC has cost me in the range of $2100 - $2300. My love of computers has stayed with me and has influenced my decision of becoming a computer engineering major. And to think that all of this started because I wanted a better gaming experience than an Xbox.</p>
