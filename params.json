(http://imgur.com/a/VPhHL)\r\n\r\nAs I got older, I wanted to know more about how more complicated technologies worked. This led to my interest in computers. In the winter of 2012 I built my first computer by myself with only information that i gained from online videos. I was so excited that I was able to understand and build a computer, a feat that the rest of my family thought was magic. After my first computer my thirst for further in formation only got larger. In total, I have built 6 computers for friends and family, and my current PC has cost me in the range of $2100 - $2300. My love of computers has stayed with me and has influenced my decision of becoming a computer engineering major. And to think that all of this started because I wanted a better gaming experience than an Xbox.\r\n\r\n### Personal Interests\r\n+ Playing Guitar\r\n+ Electronic Repair\r\n+ Playing Baseball\r\n+ Skateboarding\r\n+ Playing Video games\r\n\r\n(http://imgur.com/a/FDqqT)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Previous Employment\r\nMy first and current job is working at my local McDonald's, and while it isn't as challenging intellectually, I gained many helpful skills, such as:\r\n+ Time management\r\n+ Training new employees\r\n+ Giving instructions/Managing other employees\r\n+ A good work ethic\r\n\r\nI also worked at the Eden School District over the Summer setting up Desktops and IPad's! for the next year.\r\n\r\n#Contact\r\nYou can contact me at my email: jfeasleyrb@gmail.com\r\n",
